# WEB 101 | THE FRONT-END | Google Project: HTML & CSS

[**Submission Instructions (Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab)**](https://github.com/SocialHackersAcademy/FrontEndCourseExercises/#instructions)

#### INSTRUCTIONS

##### Easy Version: Build the [Google.com](http://www.google.com) homepage

(the simple one with just a search box).

Inside your project folder, create your index.html file

1. Tips:
    - It doesn't have to be perfect. Just try to make it look like google.com. 
   - Ignore any dropdown menus, form submission and hover highlighting.  
   - If you can't figure out something google it. 
   - [Set up the live server extension](https://youtu.be/mGORIVStWWc) in VSCode.
   - If you are using Firefox and you have problems with styling inputs or buttons, look into the css property `-webkit-appearance: none;` or `-moz-appearance`
   - [Here's a link to the Google Logo](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)
   - [Here's a cached page of the Google home page for reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/)

2. Steps:
    - Place the logo image and search form.
    - Position them horizontally.
    - You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your `<img>` tag.
    - Create the navbar with its content.
    - Position the navbar to the top of the page. If you have difficulties with that check out [how to build a horizontal CSS navbar](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp)
    - Create the footer as you did with the navbar.  

3. Do as much work as you can on your own. (Hint: If you get stuck use the developer tools or view the page's source code)

4. Push your project to Github using the instructions above. 

##### Difficult Version (optional): Build the [Google.com search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage)

1. Tips:
    - Reuse much of the code from the previous project.
    - Once more focus on the placement and the order of the elements. 
    - Don't worry if the links don't work.
    - Don't worry about the form not submitting.
    - Hard code the search results. 

Important Notice: When you inspect an element in Google's home page you will see that the classes, id's and names are nonsensical strings (for example `<div class='srg'>`). This is because the code was **Minified** ([see the Wikipedia entry here](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>)), which removes or shortens unnecessary characters and names to help the page load faster. The HTML (or Javascript or CSS) file will be smaller but the browser can still read it just fine.
